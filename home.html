			<p>In IT 270, you will first learn to create basic webpage content by utilizing HTML tags and then expand and further stylize that content using basic and intermediate CSS, all of which you will learn to use to create a holistic design for your own final project website. You will practice coding skills in each of these areas throughout the course, while utilizing several planning templates that will help you determine your site’s purpose and audience, structure and navigation, and finally the overall design including color palette and typography. In Module One, you will learn about a plain-text code editor and how to set up your free web hosting space. Module One will also cover the basic structure, or “wireframe,” of an HTML page and teach you about introductory HTML tags.</p>
